# Cinema Time Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Cinema Timesâ€™s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

For the majority of users, we do not collect any information. The app does not share information about your device, what you watch, or who you are.

The app does keep a on-device log file with information such as when a movie was added to a list, or which steps during sync were called. This log file is saved and stored on-device, and is only used when using the "Send Feedback" button of the app by attaching this file to the email. If you wish to not include this file with your support email, you may tap on it and detach it from the email. The information within the log file is useful to help with support issues.
We do not share your personal information with outside parties ever. Emails are only kept for the duration of the support inquiry and are deleted immediately after finding a resolution to the inquiry, or up to a month if waiting for response.

## Information Usage

The information collected is only used for the purpse of providing support to the user who sent it.

## Third-party links and content

Cinema Time displays links and content from third-party entertainment sites, and downloads movie information and posters from these sites. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?

Trakt.tv: Cinema Time uses the Trakt.tv API for movie information, and sync if you have signed in / created an account with Trakt.tv

## I have a question that isn't answered here.

Please [contact us](support@cinematime.app) and we'll get back to you.
