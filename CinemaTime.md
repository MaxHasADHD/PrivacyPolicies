# Cinema Time Privacy Policy

## Information we collect
The app (Cinema Time) saves your data (movies, lists, watches, app settings, etc) on your device. This data only ever leaves the device if you're signed in to Trakt.tv, in which case we'll sync your actions (Marking a movie as watched, adding to a list, creating a list, etc) to Trakt.tv via their API.

## Information Usage
Information collected is only used for the purpose of improving the app, and customer support. I do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Cinema Time's functionality.

## Third-party links and content
Cinema Time displays links and content from third-party sites such as trakt.tv, themoviedb.org, and thetvdb.com. These sites have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?
### Trakt
When signed into Trakt, Cinema Time may collect your Trakt content history for the purposes of syncing this information between your devices. Refer to Trakt's Privacy Policy for more information on how your data is handled.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Your Consent
By using the Cinema Time app or website, you consent to my privacy policy.

## Revisions to this privacy policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately upon posting this page.

## I have a question that isn't answered here.
Please [contact us](support@cinematime.app) and we'll get back to you.
