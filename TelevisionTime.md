# Television Time Privacy Policy

## Information we collect
Television Time stores information about your shows, episodes, progress, and app settings. This information is saved locally to the device, and if enabled, will sync between your devices using the same Apple ID / Trakt.tv account. The app also keeps a record of the actions performed in the app such as which shows were added and episodes watched to a file saved on the device called a log.

## Information Usage
Information collected is only used for the purpose of improving the app, and customer support. I do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Television Time's functionality.

## Log file
This file only ever leaves your device when using the "Send Feedback" feature of the app and is used to provide customer support. The log file does not include any personally identifiable information. If you wish to not include this file with your support email, you may tap on it and detach it from the email.

## Third-party links and content
Television Time displays links and content from third-party sites such as trakt.tv, themoviedb.org, and thetvdb.com. These sites have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?
### Trakt
When signed into Trakt, Television Time may collect your Trakt content history for the purposes of syncing this information between your devices. Refer to Trakt's Privacy Policy for more information on how your data is handled.

### iCloud
Television Time saves some of your data in Apple's iCloud service, such as your shows and episodes to enable sync between all devices signed into your Apple ID.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Your Consent
By using the Television Time app or website, you consent to my privacy policy.

## Revisions to this privacy policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately upon posting this page.

## I have a question that isn't answered here.
Please [contact us](support@televisiontime.app) and we'll get back to you.
