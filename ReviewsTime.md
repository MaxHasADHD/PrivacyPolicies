# Reviews Time Privacy Policy

## Information the app collects
The apps you follow are saved locally on device and is not shared with anyone. On launch the app will create a unique identifier that is saved to your Apple Id through iCloud, and sent to RevenueCat to be able to recognize purchases across devices signed in to the same Apple Id to unlock bonus features such as alternative app icons, and homescreen widgets.

## Is my personal data shared with the developer?
Besides the information that is collected through RevenueCat, I do not collect, store, or share any other information.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?
### RevenueCat:
Reviews Time uses RevenueCat to simplify in-app purchases implementation. Refer to RevenueCat's [Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy) for more information on how your data is handled.

## Your Consent
