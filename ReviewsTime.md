# Reviews Time Privacy Policy

If you're looking for a privacy policy full of legalese, you won't find one here. This is because we don't collect or store your personal data. 

## Is my personal data shared with the developer or anyone else?

No. The apps you follow for reviews are saved locally on your device. Your personal data is never sent to the developer or anyone else.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?

RevenueCat: If you purchase a tip from our app then RevenueCat processes the payment and will collect and store information related to the payment.

## I have a question that isn't answered here.

Please [contact us](maxlitteral+ReviewsTimeSupport@gmail.com) and we'll get back to you.
