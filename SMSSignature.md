# SMS Signature+ Privacy Policy

If you're looking for a privacy policy full of legalese, you won't find one here. This is because we don't collect or store your personal data. 

## Is my personal data shared with the developer or anyone else?

No data is shared off of your devices. Your signatures are stored locally and shared between the main app and iMessage app for SMS Signature+, but none of that data leaves the device to me or any services.

## What other entities does the developer use to process or store personal data?

None

## I have a question that isn't answered here.

Please [contact us](maxlitteral+SMSSignatureSupport@gmail.com) and we'll get back to you.
